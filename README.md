# One-Tap Task — .NET MAUI Demo App

A minimal **.NET MAUI** application that demonstrates how to manage UI state and instantly reflect changes in the interface using **XAML + C#**.

This project was designed as a **live demo app** for **.NET Conf 2025 Zambia**, focusing on fundamentals rather than complexity.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this app is to show how quickly you can build a clean, cross-platform application with .NET MAUI using:

* Declarative UI with XAML
* Simple state management in C#
* Instant UI updates based on user interaction
* A single shared codebase for multiple platforms

No advanced frameworks. No external dependencies. Just core MAUI.

---

## 🧩 What the App Does

* Displays a single task
* Shows the task’s current status: **Pending** or **Completed**
* Allows the user to toggle the task state with one tap
* Updates text, color, and button label instantly

This keeps the logic simple while clearly demonstrating how UI and state work together.

---

## 🏗️ App Structure (High Level)

* **MainPage.xaml**
  Defines the UI layout (labels, button, spacing)

* **MainPage.xaml.cs**
  Holds the task state and handles button click logic

Everything lives in one page to keep the learning curve low and the demo fast.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **.NET MAUI**
* **XAML** for UI
* **C#** for logic
* Runs on:

  * Android
  * Windows

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio 2022+**
2. Select a target platform (Android Emulator or Windows)
3. Press **Run**

That’s it.

---

## 📸 Demo Preview

> *(Optional: Add a screenshot or GIF here after the conference)*

---

## 🧠 Why This App Matters

This app is intentionally small, but it highlights the **core value of .NET MAUI**:

* One project
* One UI definition
* One codebase
* Multiple platforms

It’s a practical starting point for beginners and a clean teaching example for live presentations.

---

## 🔮 Possible Extensions (Not Implemented)

* Multiple tasks (list view)
* MVVM pattern
* Local storage
* Animations
* Dark mode customization

These are intentionally excluded to keep the demo focused and reliable.

## 📄 License

MIT License — free to use, modify, and learn from.

If you want, next we can:

* Tune this README for **conference branding**
* Add **speaker notes** inside the repo
* Create a **demo checklist** you can glance at on stage

Just say the word.
